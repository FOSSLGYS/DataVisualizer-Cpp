# DataVisualizer-Cpp

####Project Description

Data visualizer is a QT/C++ based application designed to give a visual representation of various data structures, currently, stack, queue, and binary min heap. It provides an easy to add framework so that additional data structuress may be added in future.

####Tools and Technology

The project has been developed in QT Creator IDE, using C++ based QGraphics framework for GUI elements. Specific instructions on how to download, setup and run using QT creator are present in the [Instructions Wiki](https://github.com/FOSSLGYS/DataVisualizer-Cpp/wiki).

####The Repository Details

The "DataVisualizer" folder contains all the source, UI and header files. This folder can be opened as a project in "QT creator" IDE. 

The project's design organizes into the following components.

#####Datastructure Component

Every datastructure type (DS) to be visualized has a UI file, CPP source file and a header file with a class definition. Common interface APIs have been added for every DST such as insert/remove/clear/cleanup. These APIs have the implementation required for displaying a specific DST. 

#####Display Component

Display types such as list (used in queue and stack DSes) and tree (used in min Heap and BST DSes) have been abstracted and defined in the visualizer header and cpp files.

#####Main GUI

Top level GUI source/UI is handled in files titled "main".

####Style

* Class names should not be typedefed (e.g. typedef class TypeX TypeX) whereas structs may (e.g. typedef struct DataTypeX DataTypeX)
